    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <span class="date">Last updated: February 27, 2026</span>

    <p>By using Poster ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Poster is a content management tool that allows TikTok creators to upload video content to their TikTok accounts through TikTok's official Content Posting API. Videos are uploaded to your TikTok inbox, where you can review and publish them from the TikTok app.</p>

    <h2>2. TikTok Account Authorization</h2>
    <p>To use Poster, you must authorize the App to access your TikTok account through TikTok's official OAuth 2.0 flow. By authorizing, you grant Poster permission to upload video content to your account's inbox. You may revoke this access at any time through your TikTok account settings.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for all content you upload through Poster.</li>
        <li>You must comply with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/terms-of-service/en" target="_blank">TikTok's Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/" target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a>.</li>
        <li>You must have the rights to all content you upload.</li>
        <li>You must not use Poster for any unlawful purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Poster is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation. TikTok may change their API or policies at any time, which could affect the App's functionality.</p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Poster and its developers shall not be liable for any damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to account restrictions imposed by TikTok.</p>

    <h2>6. Content Ownership</h2>
    <p>You retain all rights to content you upload through Poster. We do not claim any ownership over your content.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using Poster at any time by removing your accounts and revoking API access through TikTok's settings. We reserve the right to discontinue the service at any time.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of Poster after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
